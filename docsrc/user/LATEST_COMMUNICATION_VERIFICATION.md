# Latest Communication Verification

This page keeps the current public summary only. Older detailed notes are not kept in the public documentation set.

## Current Retained Summary

- fully verified families in the retained compatibility summary: `iQ-R` and `iQ-L`
- profile-limited families in the retained compatibility summary: `MELSEC-Q`, `MELSEC-L`, `iQ-F`, and third-party MC-compatible endpoints
- retained stability work confirms the current helper layer across sync, async, mixed-frame, and concurrency scenarios
- recommended first public test: `D100`, `D200:F`, and `D50.3`

## Practical Public Conclusions

- `iQ-R` and `iQ-L` are the cleanest first-run paths for the current public helper surface
- for `MELSEC-Q`, `MELSEC-L`, `iQ-F`, and third-party MC-compatible endpoints, prefer the profile combinations documented in the retained compatibility summary
- `D`, `M`, `X`, `Y`, `R`, and `ZR` remain the core public families for beginner use

## Current Cautions

- keep frame type and PLC series explicit for every connection
- keep module-buffer families such as `G` and `HG` out of the first smoke test
- public docs keep only the current recommendation-level summary, not the historical probe archive

## Where Older Evidence Went

Public historical validation clutter was removed. Maintainer-only retained evidence now belongs under `internal_docs/`.
