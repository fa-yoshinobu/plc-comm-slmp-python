## Supported Word Devices

| Family | Kind | Example | Numbering |

## High-Level Views

| Form | Example | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| plain word | `D100` | unsigned 16-bit word |
| signed view | `D100:S` | signed 16-bit value |
| dword view | `D200:D` | unsigned 32-bit value |
| long view | `D300:L` | signed 32-bit value |
| float view | `D200:F` | float32 value |
| bit in word | `D50.3` | one bit inside a word |

## Addressing Notes

- Start with `D` for the first smoke test.
- `X`, `Y`, `B`, `W`, `SB`, `SW`, `DX`, and `DY` use hexadecimal device numbers.
- Most other families use decimal numbers.
- `.bit` is valid only on word devices such as `D50.3`.
- `LTN`, `LSTN`, and `LCN` default to 32-bit current-value access in the public high-level helpers.

## Not Currently in the Public Surface

- `LTS`
- `LTC`
- `LSTS`
- `LSTC`
- `LCS`
- `LCC`
- `LZ`
- `G`
- `HG`

If a family is not listed above, do not treat it as publicly supported by the current high-level API.
