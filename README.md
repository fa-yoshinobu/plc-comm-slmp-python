# MELSEC SLMP for Python

Python library for MELSEC SLMP (Binary 3E/4E) PLC communication.

## Supported PLC profiles

The maintained profile table is in [PLC profiles](docsrc/user/PROFILES.md). Choose one exact canonical PLC profile from that table.

## Supported device types

The maintained device and range tables are in [Supported registers](docsrc/user/SUPPORTED_REGISTERS.md). Use that page for supported device families, address syntax, and profile-specific notes.

## Installation

```bash
pip install slmp-connect-python
```

## Quick example

```python
import asyncio
from slmp import SlmpConnectionOptions, open_and_connect, read_typed

async def main() -> None:
    options = SlmpConnectionOptions(host="192.168.250.100", port=1025, plc_profile="melsec:iq-r")
    async with await open_and_connect(options) as client:
        value = await read_typed(client, "D100", "U")
        print(f"D100={value}")

asyncio.run(main())
```
